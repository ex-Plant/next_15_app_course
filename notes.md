**generate metadata**

export const metadata: Metadata = {
title: "Create Next App",
description: "Generated by create next app",
};

you can add it at the layout level and than overwrite it on the page level if you want to have a dynamic title or
description

**dynamic obj name**

const handleChange(e) => {
const objName = e.target.name
const value = e.target.value

`setForm((curr) => {
        return {
            ...curr,
            [objName]: value
        }
    } 
}
`



- **mounting** 
- adding component to the DOM
- unmounting is the opposite

UseEffect runs when the component mounts and unmounts or whenever the dependency changes

cleanup function runs on unmount so that we can get rid of all the effects running in the background - we don't want 
them running when the component is not in the DOM anymore 

Lets say we are doing something like setting an interval 

*usePathname*
- from next/navigation 
- use to get the current path
